                                     I am UKCP registered intergretive Psychotherapist, I am also CABP (Chiron Association of Body Psychotherapists) registered. I have worked for a number of Employee Assisted Programmes and am especially experienced in working with issues of work place bullying and the power dynamics. 

I am also a qualified and practicing occupational therapist & hypnotherapist. It is a combination of all 3 professions that enables me to bring my unique approach to my practice enabling me to  provide a tailor made intervention for  my clients. 

I have worked for 10 years in a leading mental health charity in inner city london with a variety of issues where I was managing a prescribed drugs project and successfully establishing withdrawal programmes to gradually reduce & eventually suspend prescribed medication altogether  working closely with other health professionals. I have worked in a variety of settings ranging from voluntary sector, health, education and the private sector. I have worked for over 2 years in a private Eating Disorders clinic for children and young adults. This role gave me an insight into issues such as; body dysmorphia; Pervasive Arousal Withdrawal Syndrome and complex family dynamics. I have always beleived in young people and it is here that i came to fully appreciate their need to be heard, verbally and non-verbally.

                                    I am particularly drawn to working with inter-cultura and gender related issues. Being raised with a dual identity of being both punjabi and a British Asian, has brought many challenges as well as priveleges. I draw on my experience when relating to clients with any type of identity challenges. As a parent, healthy family dynamics are of the utmost importance to me and i am passionate about reconciling differences in families. I have experience of working with the onset of seperation and divorce, the effects on all family members, in particular the parties involved. Such a change can trigger all types of primary issues, such as; abondonment; attachment and low self esteem. My own experience of major loss, inspired me to work with my clients through their bereavements and all of the issues that arise when greiving.  
                                    My practice has grown organically and I work intuitively, so these are the issues that chose me and I beleive they happen to be at the crux of humanity.
