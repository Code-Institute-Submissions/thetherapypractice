<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 death">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Death and the cultural experience </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> At this stage in my life i am fortunate enough not to view death as i once did. I now look upon death as a new beginning and defintitley not the end. But i also know exactly how heart wrenching greiving a loved one is. This is also worsened when you consider your relationship with the deceased and sometimes we have so many unanswered questions or feel abondoned and even betrayed by a persons passing.  </p>
</div>

<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 depression">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Depression </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> There has been a massive shift, but there is still a MAJOR stigma toward depression and especially when women suffer with it. people are very quick to remind us that we are women and therefore pre disposed to being weaker and more dramatic about our 'feelings'. the truth is that 2323211 people with depression, its nothing to be ashamed of etc i use... to work on..  </p>
</div>

<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 child-parent">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Child Parent Relationships </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> I have worked with a number of parents struggling with difficulties presented by their children often altering family dynamics.

I work with families & assist in reconciling differences by offering a safe non judgemental space for each party to have a voicemy childeren are my biggest achievment and i am so proud to be a mother. however that is not to sugar coat over the sheer difficulty of the job. i am still learning and work hard on maintaining open lines of commnuincation boundaries and respect with my children and now want to help every other mother do the same. so much of parenting is about adjusting our mindsets etc </p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 anxiety">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Anxiety </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> I would say anxiety is one of the major aspects i cover in my work because cdkjdsk % of people deal with it. it is trigggered by.... for me i relaised i was struggling with anxiety after experiencing a major loss and reacting v badly to public transport. I would experience, what i know now, to be anxiety attacks </p>
</div>

<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 identity">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Identity Crisis </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> I would say Identity Crisis is one of the major aspects i cover in my work because cdkjdsk % of people deal with it. As a second generation punjabi immigrant, i fully understand the ramifications of being displaced from your original 'home'. Ethnic minorities living in western countries such as britain are constantly grappling with.... my first hand experience with this has also allowed me to understand other forms of ic, such as being a woman, a mother. I have also had great success with people struggling to identify their sexual orientation and indeed the combination of suxuality / gender and race identity crisis. </p>
</div>

<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 relationship">

<h3 class="uppercase"> Relationship Breakdown </h3>
<p class="general-sub"> our relationships are modelled from our primary relatiosnhips. I would say Early Wounds and primary relationships is one of the major aspects i cover in my work because cdkjdsk % of people deal with it. as an ethnic female there was a great deal of shame and fear around my personal relationship breakdown. i also focus on breakdown of relationship within families and parents. i draw on Transactional analysis theory to help parties understand where each is coming from ... </p>
