<h1 class="uppercase"> Issues I work with</h1>
<p class="general-sub"> In my time as a Psychotherapist I have come across plenty of different cases and generally feel very equipped to deal with most things. Some themes come up quite repetitively and some of those are outlined below. Like I mentioned on my about me page, I believe in organic connections and thoroughly believe that the right relationships will come into fruition. These are some of the issues that 'chose me' as it were... 
If your 'issue' does not appear below, please dont be disheartened, im pretty sure i can still help!</p>

<h3 class="uppercase"> Greif and Loss </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub "> Death of a loved one can trigger overwhelming emotions, ranging from; shock; disbelief; betrayal and sadness. Grief isn't only a response to death, it can be triggered by any type of loss, for example; moving home; divorce and changing career. Every loss is individual and valid. No two people will have the same reaction to the same event, our grieving mechanisms are a compilation of many factors, such as; our life experiences; our rearing and our personality.  </p>

<h3 class="uppercase"> Depression </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> 
 Living with depression can make it difficult to cope with, daily life, for example; finding work; sustaining relationships and general inclusion in society. There has been a massive shift, but there is still a MAJOR societal stigma surrounding depression. The facts speak for themselves <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Mental%20health%20report.pdf" class="depression-stat"> '914,300 adults of working age' </a> suffer from depression in London,(in the UK) alone! Discrimination experienced by those living with depression can make recovery even harder.  It's nothing to be ashamed of and no one needs to suffer alone.      </p>

<h3 class="uppercase">Child-Parent Relationships  </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub">  
 I have worked with several parents struggling with difficulties presented by their children often altering family dynamics.

I work with families & assist in reconciling differences by offering a safe none judgemental space for each party to have a voice. My children are my biggest achievement and I feel so blessed to be a parent. Although I think we can all agree, parenting is no picnic! I am still learning and work hard on maintaining open lines of communication and respecting boundaries with my children and now want to work with other parents with the challenges they face.

<h3 class="uppercase"> Anxiety </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> 
I have effective results with treating anxiety from a body orientated approach due to the varying physical symptoms experienced in the body.
As soon as the danger is recognised the brain sends a message to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, in turn, releases a hormone which sends a message to the adrenal glands.
The adrenal glands then release another hormone CORTISOL which converts Glycogen stored in the liver into blood sugar to provide instant energy. This instant energy creates a variety of body processes which are carried out by the Autonomic Nervous System. 
This is a primitive response & the autonomic system can’t differentiate between the stress of being caught in traffic or being chased by a man-eating tiger. Avoiding anxiety & worrying about it makes it worse, one needs to recognise their triggers and begin to break their cycle of anxiety.

<h3 class="uppercase"> Issues surrounding Identity</h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> 
 Identity is part of a person’s self–conception & self-perception. It can be related to; nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. 
 A persons identity is important because it aids the preservation of history and therefore provides individuals with a place where they feel they belong. As a second-generation Punjabi (Asian) woman I understand how it feels to struggle with some aspects of one's identity.
My personal and professional experience of working with this has also allowed me to understand other forms of identity issues, such as; sexual orientation, gender and race. It is also important to understand that many of us have dual identity's; you may have a family-culture; a religious culture; a socio-economic culture. All of these cultures form aspects of your identity and naturally, we sometimes struggle to integrate our various identities.  </p>

<h3 class="uppercase"> Relationship Breakdown </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub">   
In my experience,our relationships are based on our primary relationships. We often model our adult relationships on our early experiences, perhaps, repeating patterns of the relationships we had with our primary carers. Through our self-awareness, we can start to recognise the patterns that have led to our current ways of relating to others. 

<h4 class="relationship-type">Exploration with your significant other</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
This includes whoever you are struggling to have a healthy relationship with, for example; family members; romantic partners; friends and colleagues. 
Once the issues are brought to the surface we can then look at how you can best effectively communicate in your relationship/s. All relationships are unique requiring different types of nourishment. </p>

<h4 class="relationship-type">Individual exploration</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
Everyone presents with a unique stage of their journey.
If you are planning to embark on a relationship you may want to explore your way of being. 
If you want to improve your current relationship or even, want to end a relationship, you may want to do it as safely as possible. 

I can also assist you with looking at what a good relationship for YOU looks like. What needs of yours need to be met and how this can happen.</p>
