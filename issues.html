<h1 class="uppercase"> Issues I work with</h1>
<p class="general-sub"> In my time as a Psychotherapist I have come across plenty of different cases and generally feel very equipped to deal with most things. There are obviously some themes that come up quite repetitvely and some of those are outlined below. Like i mentioned on my about me page, i beleiev in organic connections and thoroughly beleieve that the right relationships will come into fruition. These are some of the issues that 'chose me' as it were.. 
If your 'issue' does not appear below, please dont be disheartened, im pretty sure i can still help! </p>

<div class="container-fluid">

<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg">
<h3 class="uppercase"> Greif and Loss </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> Deat of a loved one can trigger overwhelming emotions, ranging from; shock; disbeleif; betrayal and sadness. Greif isnt only a response to death, it can be triggered by any type of loss, for example; moving home; divorce and changing career. Every loss is indivdual and valid. No two people will have the same reaction to the same event, our greiving mechanisms are a compilation of many factors, such as; our life experiences; our rearing and our personality.   </p>

<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4" id="depression">
<div class="dp">
<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg">
<h3 class="uppercase"> Depression </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> Living with depression can make it difficult to cope with, daily life, for example; finding work; sustaining relationships and general inclusion in society. There has been a massive shift, but there is still a MAJOR societal stigma surrounding depression. The facts speak for themselves  2323211 people suffer with depression in London, UK alone! Discrimination experienced by those living with depression can make recovery even harder.  It's nothing to be ashamed of and noone needs to suffer alone.   </p>

<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg">
<h3 class="uppercase"> Child Parent Relationships </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> I have worked with a number of parents struggling with difficulties presented by their children often altering family dynamics.

I work with families & assist in reconciling differences by offering a safe non judgemental space for each party to have a voice. My childeren are my biggest achievement and I feel so blessed to be a parent. Although, I think we can all agree, parenting is no picnic! I am still learning and work hard on maintaining open lines of commnunication and respecting boundaries with my children and now want to work with other parents with the challenges they face.  </p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4" id="anxiety">
<div class="ax">
<div class="col col-sm-2 col-md-4 col-lg">
<h2 class="uppercase"> Anxiety </h2>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> 
I have effective results with treating anxiety from a body orientated approach due to the varying  physical symptoms  experienced in the body.
As soon as danger is recognised the brain sends a message to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland in turn releases a hornmone which sends a message to the adrenal glands.
The adrenal glands then release another hornmone CORTISOL which converts Glycogen stored in the liver into blood sugar to provide instant energy. This instant energy creates a variety of body processes which are carried out by the Autonomic Nervous System. 
This is a primitive response & the autonomic system can’t differentiate between the stress of being caught in traffic or being chased by a man-eating tiger. Avoiding anxiety & worrying about it makes it worse, one needs to recognise their triggers and begin to break their cycle of anxiety.

<div class="ic">
<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg">
<h3 class="uppercase"> Issues surrounding Identity</h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> Identity is part  of a person’s self–conception & self perception. It can be related to; nationality,ethnicity,religion,social class , generation,locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. 
 A persons identity is important because it aids the preservation of history and therefore provides individuals with a place where they feel they belong. As a second generation punjabi (Asian) woman i totally understand how it feels to struggle with some aspects of ones identity.
My personal and proffesional experience of working with this has also allowed me to understand other forms of identity issues, such as; sexual orientation, gender and race. It is also ipmportant to understand that many of us have dual identity's; you may have a family-culture; a religious culture; a socio economic culture. All of these cultures form aspects of your identity and naturally we sometimes struggle to integrate our various identities. </p>

<div class="rb">
<div class="col col-sm col-md col-lg">
<h3 class="uppercase"> Relationship Breakdown </h3>
</div>
<p class="general-sub"> our relationships are modelled from our primary relatiosnhips. I would say Early Wounds and primary relationships is one of the major aspects i cover in my work because cdkjdsk % of people deal with it. as an ethnic female there was a great deal of shame and fear around my personal relationship breakdown. i also focus on breakdown of relationship within families and parents. i draw on Transactional analysis theory to help parties understand where each is coming from ... </p>
