## UX (User Experience) :control_knobs:

### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to create an online extension of the work of Charanjit Dosanjh; Psychotherapist, Occupational Therapist, Hypnotherapist and inevitably result in an increase of clients for her to help. The website is aimed toward anyone seeking guidance with their emotional difficulties. The website will be promoting a very personal service (Psychotherapy)and aims to be inclusive to people of all ages backgrounds and genders. Due to the nature of the service, a whole range of people are likely to be interested and click on the site, therefore the website needs to be particulary accesible for people at all stages of technicalogical understanding. The website must be aesthetically pleasing, informative, sincere and easy to navigate. 

#### User Stories:
* As a user I expect to find information about a therapists credibility when I visit their site. 
* As a user, if I am browsing potential therapists, I want to know their rates and locality to me.
* As a user I would like to have minimal clicks, when trying to find the relevant information. 
* As a user, I want to know what experience the Therapist has, I want to know I am in good hands.
* As a user I want to be able to book a sessions quickly and easily. 

#### User Stories (in detail)::open_book:

####Annie Lovett (43/ female):

> I am not the best at technology at all! I do like it when the services I am interested in has a website because then I can find the contact details and email straight away, whilst I'm on the go! When looking for a Therapist the most important thing to me is, that the rates are listed clearly and the contact information, alike. I already know that I want a therapist, it comes down to the person, the money and how to get in contact for me!



The therapy practice is  
 Charanjit Has been wanting to create a virtual presence for quite some time, however has never gone through with it becuase of fear of the unknown. She is in her fifties and still pretty afraid of technology. In addition to this, typically psychotherapist, especially in the uk, have been able to rely on word of mouth for their clients. However now that the world is so fast paced and technologly driven, people are a lot more sceptical if you dont even have a website!

Strategy
Business Objectives
- Promote Charanjit Dosanjh as a virtual psychotherapist 
- Provide enough informtaion on the site to entice the typoes of people she will be able to help best 
- Clearly display Charanjit's credentials in a clear and concise format. We live in an age where many people are claiming to be therapists/ advisors, however few have the proffesional experience or indeed education to justify these claims. 
- Assist people to improve their mental health, irrespecitve of where they live in the world. 
    
    Client Objectives
- Looking for a genuine psychotherapist 
- Clear information about what services are provided
- Easy to find the credentials of the therapist as well as some of their experience. 
- Therapists sometimes hesitate to state their fees in a clear readable way, this puts off potential clients as they are delayed from learning the vital information. Clients want to know this information, however in a clear pallatable manor, accompanied with clear terms and conditions. 
- Easy to contact and indeed easy to book in sessions.


The nature of 'Therapy' is extremely personal. A person who is looking for a psycho therapist, already knows what they want, they just want to know who you are and how hgenuine your help can be to theior lives.

I wanted to keep the website functional above all and not overwhelm potential clients with many animations or transitions. professionalism was of the utmost importance to charanjit and i also wanted to insure that the site was welcoming to other people in her age group that may also find technology somewhat intimidating. 

This website is hoping to entice a range of people, anyomne who is looking for help, because they come in all shapes and sizes. 
Also, younger people will be interested to find a free lance therapist who has a website and slightly elder people will appreciate how easily they can navigate through the pages and source all of the relevenat information. 

user stories 
- ‘I want to know about this therapists experience and if they have ever worked with someone who has similar issues to me ’
- ‘Therapy is so personal, so i need to get a sense of who this person is and if they will be able to support me.’
- ‘I want to find all of the information i require very easily ’
- ‘I dont want to be too overwhlemed by the design aspect of this site, because that will make me feel that the therapist is not genuine and more concerned with their public pereption. ’

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

Features
A landing page was vital, as i thought it was necessary to describe and educate pepole on psycho therapy as a whole, it also saves time for the potential client. without the about.html page they may have become very invested in Charanjit Dosanjh, with her impressive skill set and experience, but disappointed when they learn how long and intircate the process of psychotherapy is. 

The logo which is consitent on all page is also a another way of landing back on the home page which was one of the features inputted with a slightly elder audience in mind. 

the video was embedded and taken from the ukcp website, which is the therapist asscoaition that charanjit belongs to and is acredited by. i thought this was a quick, engaging and interactive way of explainig the above and not spread wrong informtaion. 

The about-me.html page was the page with the most agonisng, again due to the nature of therapy it is important to maintain profefesionalism and charanjit was not keen on having many pictures on there oif her self.  i thought it was important for the client to really get a sense of who she is on this page so on the two columns that sit beside the main picture of charanjit,have another backgroung picture of her and for ease of reading the copy, the hover function helps to read the text. in order to not over load the potential client with information i wanted her training and work history to be easy to read. i thought this way of settingit out would be beneficial for the viewer. 

the issues i deal with page just goes into detail about all of the potential issues she can hekp you deal with and a little explanation on each. I thought the use of the drop down on issues in the nav bar was good because it lists all of the issues so you are bale to see if she can hekp you. 

the how i work page is the most crucial, but i wanted to be most careful with how all the information on this page was laid out. i did not want it to be too overwhelming, i thought the use of a giph would make it fun and interactive and also i was very careful about the wording of the form. 

i thought that the checkbox function on the form, insuring that the terms and conditions were read and agreed to before submiting were vital!

the footer, is where people who are not interested in spending much time on the site, have been considererd, onn charanjits opinion it would have been unproffesional to have a call to action on every page about booking a consultation. howver from a business pov it was important that the people who are only interesting in booking have an easily navigatbale way of getting there. 

i also insured there was continuity with the hover colour throughtout the site and a link to the terms and conditions. 

also a breif ouline of who she is and her services. 

as well as her accreditors, which is a legal requirement.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
