		<p class="general-sub">I offer an intuitive safe space in which you can explore your issues at your own
			pace.
			There are no age barriers to embarking on your journey of Psychotherapy. Trauma can be generational

			<p class="general-sub"> I have am a trained OT and Hypno therapist as well as Psychotherapist, my approach
				is influenced by my entire professioanl experience. Here are just a few approaches I use with my
				clients, do a bit of research into them, see if any of them resonate with you!</p>

				<h1 class="uppercase"> Psychodynamic Perspective</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="general-sub">Most of us have accepted that our childhood laid the foundations of our current
				behaviour (good or bad). The Psychodynamic perspctive interprets the mental and emotional processes
				behind the behaviour to find their patterns and start to work with them.

				<h1 class="uppercase"> Mindfulness and Visualisation </h1>
			</div>
			<p class="general-sub"> I was practising mindfulness and visualisation before it was cool! I quickly learnt
				that people do not always live in the present, we are anxious about the future and constantly stressed.
				I needed a way to centre my clients and force them to live in the present. I found visualisation a vital
				technique to help my client explore their brains capacity to go on a journey, which would build their
				confidence in their ability to change their way of being.

				<h1 class="uppercase"> Transactional Analysis Theory</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="general-sub"> I have found Trans-Actional analysis particularly useful for working with the inner
				voice. Each of us hears aspects of our own lives through different voices. For example, you may hear
				words of encouragement in an unconditional parental positive voice, whereas, if you are feeling
				constantly overwhelmed or having angry outbursts, this may be a reaction of your inner child.
				Fundamentally Transactional analysis theory looks at our ego states in child-adult and parent, this can
				assist in changing repetitive patterns of behaviour, enabling you to forge better relationships.

<p class="general-sub"> In my time as a Psychotherapist I have come across plenty of different cases and generally feel very equipped to deal with most things. Some themes come up quite repetitively and some of those are outlined below. Like I mentioned on my about me page, I believe in organic connections and thoroughly believe that the right relationships will come into fruition. These are some of the issues that 'chose me' as it were... 
If your 'issue' does not appear below, please dont be disheartened, im pretty sure i can still help!</p>

Grief isn't only a response to death, it can be triggered by any type of loss, for example; moving home; divorce and changing career. Every loss is individual and valid. No two people will have the same reaction to the same event, our grieving mechanisms are a compilation of many factors, such as; our life experiences; our rearing and our personality. </p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Anxiety</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">I have effective results with treating anxiety from a body orientated approach due to the varying physical symptoms experienced in the body.
As soon as the danger is recognised the brain sends a message to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, in turn, releases a hormone which sends a message to the adrenal glands.
The adrenal glands then release another hormone CORTISOL which converts Glycogen stored in the liver into blood sugar to provide instant energy. This instant energy creates a variety of body processes which are carried out by the Autonomic Nervous System. 
This is a primitive response & the autonomic system canâ€™t differentiate between the stress of being caught in traffic or being chased by a man-eating tiger. Avoiding anxiety & worrying about it makes it worse, one needs to recognise their triggers and begin to break their cycle of anxiety. </p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Issues surrounding Identity</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">Identity is part of a personâ€™s selfâ€“conception & self-perception. It can be related to; nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. 
 A persons identity is important because it aids the preservation of history and therefore provides individuals with a place where they feel they belong. As a second-generation Punjabi (Asian) woman I understand how it feels to struggle with some aspects of one's identity.
My personal and professional experience of working with this has also allowed me to understand other forms of identity issues, such as; sexual orientation, gender and race. It is also important to understand that many of us have dual identity's; you may have a family-culture; a religious culture; a socio-economic culture. All of these cultures form aspects of your identity and naturally, we sometimes struggle to integrate our various identities. </p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Relationship Breakdown </h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">In my experience,our relationships are based on our primary relationships. We often model our adult relationships on our early experiences, perhaps, repeating patterns of the relationships we had with our primary carers. Through our self-awareness, we can start to recognise the patterns that have led to our current ways of relating to others. </p>

<h4 class="relationship-type">Exploration with your significant other</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
This includes whoever you are struggling to have a healthy relationship with, for example; family members; romantic partners; friends and colleagues. 
Once the issues are brought to the surface we can then look at how you can best effectively communicate in your relationship/s. All relationships are unique requiring different types of nourishment. </p>

<h4 class="relationship-type">Individual exploration</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
Everyone presents with a unique stage of their journey.
If you are planning to embark on a relationship you may want to explore your way of being. 
If you want to improve your current relationship or even, want to end a relationship, you may want to do it as safely as possible. 

I can also assist you with looking at what a good relationship for YOU looks like. What needs of yours need to be met and how this can happen.</p>

This of course has its many benefits, however in my opinion, contributes to our heightened levels of stress and anxiety and lowered level of deep human connections. 

I am going to meet you in the middle, we will discuss everything in depth, however we will do this bia a virtual platform. 

Since COVID 19,  I hope that we are collectively , more aware of how important it is to look after our inneer world AND how much we can still achieve virtually. 

I realise how tough it is to make sure we prioritise ourselves, so i wanted to remove the hassle of travel and connect with you in your preferred space.   
I will carry out sessions virtually using platforms such as ;facetime; skype and zoom .  </p>
