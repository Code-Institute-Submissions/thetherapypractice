<h1 class="uppercase"> My first experience with Psychotherapy</h1>

<p class="general-sub"> It may not be common knowledge, but to become a psychotherapist, one must undergo their individual psychotherapy so that; you have a grasp of your own issues; can empathise with your client. My journey commenced when I started a psychology degree which I later continued with my training in Bio-Dynamic Psychotherapy.
Unlike my contemporaries, I was at the beginning of my career, therefore didn't have a stable financial net to draw from for my training. This made the Psychotherapy you receive as part of the course, a lot more valuable. Especially for me. 

For me, a young South Asian woman the entire experience was very alien. the concept of speaking to a stranger about all the things society had told you, you were not permitted to share was frightening, risky and extremely liberating. 
I especially benefited from the bodywork as this didn't require vocabulary and I learnt how much we could say without words. </p>

				<p class="general-sub">I offer an intuitive safe space in which you can explore your issues at your own
					pace.
					There are no age barriers to embarking on your journey of Psychotherapy. Trauma can be generational
					and the erness is on you, the individual, to break the cycle and do the self development, meaning
					that your offspring and their offspring are not burdoned with your emotional difficulties. </p>

			</div>
			<p class="genereal-sub">Most of us have accepted that our childhood laid the foundations of our current

				behind the behaviour to find their patterns and start to work with them.

				<h1 class="uppercase"> Mindfulness and Visualisation </h1>
			</div>
			<p class="general-sub"> I was practising mindfulness and visualisation before it was cool! I quickly learnt
				that people do not always live in the present, we are anxious about the future and constantly stressed.
				I needed a way to centre my clients and force them to live in the present. I found visualisation a vital
				technique to help my client explore their brains capacity to go on a journey, which would build their
				confidence in their ability to change their way of being.

				<h1 class="uppercase"> Transactional Analysis Theory</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="general-sub"> I have found Trans-Actional analysis particularly useful for working with the inner
				voice. Each of us hears aspects of our own lives through different voices. For example, you may hear
				words of encouragement in an unconditional parental positive voice, whereas, if you are feeling
				constantly overwhelmed or having angry outbursts, this may be a reaction of your inner child.
				Fundamentally Transactional analysis theory looks at our ego states in child-adult and parent, this can
				assist in changing repetitive patterns of behaviour, enabling you to forge better relationships.
