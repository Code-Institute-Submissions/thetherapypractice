		<h1 class="uppercase"> What is Psychotherapy?</h1>
		<p class="general-sub"> People often confuse Psychotherapy with Counselling or Psychiatry. Psychotherapy is commonly known as the 'talking therapy', this is because people who are struggling with all different types of issues, will sit with a psychotherapist and talk through the issues with the aim of bringing the deeper issues/ triggers to the surface.

<h1 class="uppercase"> Issues I deal With</h1>
<p class="general-sub"> In my time as a Psychotherapist I have come across plenty of different cases and generally feel very equipped to deal with most things. Some themes come up quite repetitively and some of those are outlined below. Like I mentioned on my about me page, I believe in organic connections and thoroughly believe that the right relationships will come into fruition. These are some of the issues that 'chose me' as it were... 
If your 'issue' does not appear below, please dont be disheartened, im pretty sure i can still help!</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Greif & Loss</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">Death of a loved one can trigger overwhelming emotions, ranging from; shock; disbelief; betrayal and sadness. Grief isn't only a response to death, it can be triggered by any type of loss, for example; moving home; divorce and changing career. Every loss is individual and valid. No two people will have the same reaction to the same event, our grieving mechanisms are a compilation of many factors, such as; our life experiences; our rearing and our personality. </p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Depression</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">Living with depression can make it difficult to cope with, daily life, for example; finding work; sustaining relationships and general inclusion in society. There has been a massive shift, but there is still a MAJOR societal stigma surrounding depression. The facts speak for themselves <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Mental%20health%20report.pdf" class="depression-stat" target="_blank"> '914,300 adults of working age'  </a> suffer from depression in London,(in the UK) alone! Discrimination experienced by those living with depression can make recovery even harder.  It's nothing to be ashamed of and no one needs to suffer alone.</p>

I work with families & assist in reconciling differences by offering a safe none judgemental space for each party to have a voice.Together we will work toward achieving and on maintaining open lines of communication; respecting boundaries with each other and deciding how best to handle all the other challenges we face.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Anxiety</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">I have effective results with treating anxiety from a body orientated approach due to the varying physical symptoms experienced in the body.
We have a primitive response to danger & the autonomic system can’t differentiate between the stress of being caught in traffic or being chased by a man-eating tiger. Avoiding anxiety & worrying about it makes it worse, one needs to recognise their triggers and begin to break their cycle of anxiety. </p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Issues surrounding Identity</h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">Identity is part of a person’s self–conception & self-perception. 
  As a second-generation Punjabi (Asian) woman I understand how it feels to struggle with some aspects of one's identity.
My personal and professional experience of working with this has also allowed me to understand other forms of identity issues, such as; sexual orientation, gender and race. It is also important to understand that many of us have dual identity's; you may have a family-culture; a religious culture; a socio-economic culture. All of these cultures form aspects of your identity and naturally, we sometimes struggle to integrate our various identities. </p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Relationship Breakdown </h5>
    <p class="card-text general-sub">In my experience,our relationships are based on our primary relationships. Through our self-awareness, we can start to recognise the patterns that have led to our current ways of relating to others. </p>

<h4 class="relationship-type">Exploration with your significant other</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
This includes whoever you are struggling to have a healthy relationship with, for example; family members; romantic partners; friends and colleagues. 
Once the issues are brought to the surface we can then look at how you can best effectively communicate in your relationship/s. All relationships are unique requiring different types of nourishment. </p>

<h4 class="relationship-type">Individual exploration</h4>
<p class="general-sub"> 
Everyone presents with a unique stage of their journey.
If you are planning to embark on a relationship you may want to explore your way of being. 
If you want to improve your current relationship or even, want to end a relationship, you may want to do it as safely as possible. 

I can also assist you with looking at what a good relationship for YOU looks like. What needs of yours need to be met and how this can happen.</p>

			<p class="general-sub"> I was practising mindfulness and visualisation before it was cool! I quickly learnt

				I needed a way to centre my clients and force them to live in the present. I found visualisation a vital
				technique to help my client explore their brains capacity to go on a journey, which would build their
				confidence in their ability to change their way of being.

				words of encouragement in an unconditional parental positive voice, whereas, if you are feeling
				constantly overwhelmed or having angry outbursts, this may be a reaction of your inner child.
				Fundamentally Transactional analysis theory looks at our ego states in child-adult and parent, this can

<p class="general-sub"> I embarked on my Psychotherapy career when the world was different, technology was nowhere near as developed as it is now! This of course has its many benefits, however in my opinion, contributes to our heightened levels of stress and anxiety and lowered level of deep human connections. 

I am going to meet you in the middle, we will discuss everything in depth, however we will do this bia a virtual platform. 

Since COVID 19,  I hope that we are collectively , more aware of how important it is to look after our inneer world AND how much we can still achieve virtually. 

I realise how tough it is to make sure we prioritise ourselves, so i wanted to remove the hassle of travel and connect with you in your preferred space.   
I will carry out sessions virtually using platforms such as ;facetime; skype and zoom .  </p>
